      <h2>Founders Message</h2>
      <p class="sub">
      Every sacred journey begins with faith, and every destination reveals itself only to those who travel with devotion in their hearts.

Radharamanji Yatra Parivaar was born from a lifelong commitment to pilgrimage, service, and disciplined travel management. Our founder has spent decades on the road, not merely as a tour operator, but as a true yatree who understands the spiritual, physical, and emotional depth of every parikrama and yatra.

As the owner of LaxmiNarayan Tours and Travels, she successfully built and managed a large-scale travel operation, overseeing a fleet of 25 buses and multiple cars, and coordinating countless journeys across India. This experience shaped her deep understanding of safety, logistics, punctuality, and comfort—values that remain the backbone of every yatra we organize today.

Beyond professional excellence, her journey is deeply spiritual. She has completed the Narmada Parikrama and several other challenging and revered parikramas, walking the sacred paths herself, facing the same hardships, and embracing the same devotion as fellow pilgrims. These experiences transformed her vision—turning travel into seva and tours into spiritual guidance.

Radharamanji Yatra Parivaar is not just about reaching holy places; it is about travelling with discipline, devotion, and dignity. Every itinerary is designed with care, every yatree is treated like family, and every journey is guided by experience earned on the path itself.

We invite you to walk with us—not just to destinations, but toward faith, fulfillment, and inner peace.

Radhe Radhe 🙏
